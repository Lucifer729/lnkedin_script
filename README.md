# lnkedin_script
Hello everyone, I created this userscript (Javascript) in my free time which could help you send invite  to the LinkedIn connections which are "either close to you, working in the same organisation or share same field of interest(not to everyone) in just one click"
It works by using the count of mutual connections .
# This could be potentially used by people who are actively looking to grow their professional network online.I think networking is a very good investment in one's career and we must invest in it since the start of it.
